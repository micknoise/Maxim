Maxim

OK so this was a quickly hacked together thing we did for a MOOC in 2014. I really don't think you want to use this anymore but I'll leave it here for posterity.

Cross Platform JavaScript/Java Audio DSP and Mobile Web Development Library Compatible with Processing 

Maxim is designed to make it easier to program cross platform audio for desktops amd mobile platforms.
It provides a single API for building complex audio applications on Android, iOS and the Desktop, using
the WebAudioAPI in combination with traditional Java approaches for compatibility.

It's a work in progress, but vastly simplifies the process of getting started writing audio and music software
for mobile platforms

Some notes :

If you are using javascript mode, make sure your browser supports WebAudioAPI properly. 

See here for a list of browsers that support WebAudio
